# UserLocation
## Main Task

Write an app that satisfies the following requirements:

1. Supports iOS 7.0 and later
2. Is written in Objective-C
3. The UI should have a label and a button
4. When the button is touched the label should display the user's current country based on location
5. Include a README file with a short reason as to why you used any third party libraries that you used

## Stretch Goals

For additional marks add some the following features:

- Add a button to allow the user to share their current location, e.g. send a tweet of "I am currently in {Country}" -- replace {Country} with the country the user is currently located.
- Display the current country's flag
- Check location based on IP address and display a message if different from physical location

## Notes

Note that the following points will also affect your score:

1. Even though the task is relatively small, proper OO design patterns should be used for each component.
2. We need to be able to build and run the program - make it easy for us to do so.
3. We will be looking at the code and tests and assessing style, implementation and test coverage.
